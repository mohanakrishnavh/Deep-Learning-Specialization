1. Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:
Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m_train, m_test, num_px, ...)
Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)
"Standardize" the data


2. A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a matrix X_flatten of shape (b ∗∗ c ∗∗ d, a) is to use:
X_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape[0], -1).T      # X.T is the transpose of X
